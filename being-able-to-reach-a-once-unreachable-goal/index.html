   <h2>Being able to reach a once unreachable goal.</h2>
   <p>The title of this blog is really sensationalizing my idea. However, I don&#39;t want to discount it too much before explaining my side of the story. About a two months ago I started creating a list of all the different projects I would like to build once I graduated from <a href="http://thisismetis.com">Metis</a>. This was really a list of anything I could think of that sounded interesting that didn&#39;t already exist in the marketplace. Building up to the start of class a couple of weeks ago, my list had about 15(ish) items on it. I quickly learned that I was going to have to narrow that down and eventually select one for my &quot;Passion Project&quot; or &quot;Capstone Project&quot;, which I will start building around week 9, of the 12 week bootcamp. I settled on 1 idea and have really been letting my mind churn on how I am going to accomplish the very daunting task of taking sketches on paper and building a real product. I don&#39;t want to give it away just yet, but stay tuned here for details as the weeks roll by.</p>

<p>The biggest thing that I have noticed is: I am starting to see exactly how everything is going to fall into place. Even projects that I didn&#39;t pick to be my main project have already been placed in a &quot;I am just going to build these in my spare time anyways&quot; bucket. The possibilites of what I am going to be able to accomplish are really only limited by the amount of time I want to spend on them. Something that I put on the list 2 months ago thinking that I would be able to spend the bulk of my project time on, are now things that I can look at and say, &quot;I can probably tackle that in a day, and take another day or two to make it look nice.&quot;</p>

<p>This is a great feeling. One of empowerment, confidence, and a little touch of giddiness. I am loving the ideas that I can now come up with because there are no longer those invisible walls that my brain was automatically putting in front of those seemingly unreachable goals.</p>
