   <h2>Sprinting through a marathon.</h2>
   <p>This <a href="http://thisismetis.com">Metis</a> bootcamp is a little like sprinting the whole duration of a marathon. I have been really slacking on my blogging, but only because I am constantly and consistently learning, nonstop <strong>every single day</strong>. Just to give a quick rundown on what I have learned since my last blog post, about 3 weeks ago:</p>

<ul>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Self Referential Associations</li>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>AJAX</li>
<li>Tower of Hanoi</li>
<li>Big O notation</li>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>TDD</li>
<li>Single Responsibility Principle</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s just a small sample (<em>and a randomly populated one</em>) of the different things that I have been exposed to over the past few weeks thanks to both the awesome curriculum developed by the instructors as well as some extra learning I am doing on the side to help me become extra competitive in the marketplace. Even though we have only been at this for about 6 weeks now, it seems like much longer given we are doing it everyday for 8+ hours.</p>

<p>Another thing that has really been helping me drive home some of the concepts we are learning about refactoring is a book I am reading. <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Clean_Code.html?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC"><em>Clean Code</em> : A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</a> by Robert C. Martin. It talks a lot about how you can write better, more maintainable, and more readable code that will make you a vastly more successful developer.</p>

<p>It&#39;s getting down to the wire. We are past the half way point (this Friday). I am ready for my career as a developer to get started with a great company (TBD), and even more excited to have my learning continue.</p>
